# bookify

Outline:
* Web application or iOS development
* Backend:
  * INPUT: Title of book, or ISBN, 
  * Take ISBN to Goodreads API to get summary and reviews of book
  * some model that finds good sentiment/meaningful keywords, some way of aggregating/taking away 
  * use Genius API to look through lyrics and song meanings to find matches --> wouldn't have to use Spotify's recommendation engine?
  * Log in to Spotify, makes playlist for your user
